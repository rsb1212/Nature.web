        <p>     Located around 3 km from Lonavala, Khandala is yet another amazing hill station near Pune.
             Together, Khandala and Lonavala are named, ‘Twin Hill Stations’ as they have so much in common, and most, who visit one of these, visit both. 
             Those who want to have a panoramic view of Khandala must go hiking to Duke’s Nose. Besides hiking, one can also go for rock climbing, rappelling or valley crossing in and around Khandala. If you are a history buff, you must visit the historical Karla and Bhaja caves. About 16 km from Khandala, 
            these are ancient Buddhist caves</p>
