        <p> Panchgani is another hill town located in the Sahyadri Ranges. Locals believe that Panchgani’s air has healing qualities that can help one restore their body and psyche.

            When the hill station was first discovered by the British, it didn’t have a name. The hill station was named Panchgani owing to the five villages (Amral, Dhandeghar, Khingar, Godavli and Taighat) in its vicinity.
             As the place has a pleasant weather all throughout the year, the British developed it to use it as their official summer retreat. 
            
            There are many things that you can do here, ranging from horse riding and paragliding to go karting. Besides these, you can also visit a lot of tourist attractions; some of them being Table Land, Sydney Point, Mapro Garden, Devil’s Kitchen, and Parsi Point.</p>
