        <p>        Situated amidst the Sahyadri Ranges that separate the West Coast and the Deccan Plateau, Lonavala is among
            the most frequented hill station in Pune district. In fact, the list of most amazing hill stations near Pune
            is incomplete without the mention of Lonavala.
            Lonavala is located on the Pune-Mumbai Expressway, and most of the buses passing through it, halt here.
            That’s also one of the main reasons for the surging popularity of this region.

            On reaching Lonavala, the first thing you will notice, besides its scenic beauty, is the large number of
            pompously lit chikki shops.
            ‘Chikki,’ a traditional candy made of jaggery and groundnuts, is the speciality of this region. You may not
            believe that some people living in Mumbai and Pune especially travel to Lonavala to buy this sweet during
            festive times. While in the town, remember to visit Lonavala Lake, Tiger’s Leap, Bhushi Dam, Lohagad Fort,
            Rajmachi Point and Della Adventure Park.</p>
